# Eyequest Online
EYEQUEST is a new online zine.
The first issue is to be entitled: "tonic"
it is of things created thus far during this pandemic as balm for our isolation
and a way to connect and share and see what others are making and thinking about right now
and it is a way to keep the willpower up to not listen to our government and STAY HOME.


All things under and above the sun accepted:
sound, pictures, video, games, recipes, writing, dances, questions, playlists and on on on
submit to Eve Brown or William Kennedy
by May 13, 2020!
